# Product Thinking

Most clients of saccos for example Kenya Bankers Sacco are headed the direction of easening transactions for members, allowing them to monitor and transact from sacco operating account which is like a wallet, from this wallet they can deposit to other savings accounts, they can receive loans and withdraw from it.

Sacco is aiming to align to such easier banking solutions for sacco members, allowing them to transact with fellow members using wallet to wallet transfer, allowing them to deposit to the sacco, save in various saving accounts, check progress of their saving goals over time.

The members can receive real time app notifications of funds received in their wallet and they get a distinct wallet that they can use as their property for a long time without interference.
