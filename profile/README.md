# ðŸš€ Maverick Start Program â€” Engineering Pre-Assessment

Welcome to the **Maverick Start Program Pre-Assessment**, your first step into the world of Payd. This assessment is designed to evaluate how well you can understand user needs, translate them into usable software, and think beyond limits â€” the core of what it means to be a **Maverick at Payd**.

## ðŸ§  About This Assessment

Youâ€™ll be building a **demo banking platform**. This can be frontend-only, backend-only, or full-stack depending on your track. The project will be hosted on GitHub and submitted via a **pull request** to this repository.

The assessment will test your:

- Product thinking & creativity
- Understanding of web or backend technologies
- Problem-solving with constraints
- Clarity in delivery and documentation

Worth mentioning is that all details provided here are the basics. A major part of the assesment is understanding your thought process, your ability to think outside the box and build solutions - your ability to blend in as a maverick.

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience

- Freelancers in Kenya (e.g. Upwork, Fiverr)
- Event organizers & content creators
- Cross-border teams with remote contractors
- Students with side hustles
- Community groups/Saccos

Clearly state your **target market** in your README and build with their needs in mind.

If you are feeling confident, you can play around with Payd APIs accessible via https://magic.mypayd.app to improve the functionality of your platform with real-world payments.

There is no specific timeline attached to the assesment. As you'll learn once you join the mavericks, speed is a competitive advantage, and we want to see how well you can use that to play to your advantage.
